# Manual steps

Before running ansible in a windows host, it has to be setup following next steps:
- Install remmina:
  - sudo apt-add-repository ppa:remmina-ppa-team/remmina-next
  - sudo apt update
  - sudo apt install remmina remmina-plugin-rdp remmina-plugin-secret
  - sudo killall remmina
- Run remmina and configure RDP connection -> domain = ip, user and password
- Disable windows firewall in control panel -> security -> windows firewall -> turn off option in left bar
- Open windows powershell and run the following in order to configure winRM (WinRM comes installed in windows by default but it is not enabled by default):
    - $url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
    - $file = "$env:temp\ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1"
    - (New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile($url, $file)
    - powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File $file
- pip install pywinrm

After following previous steps we run ansible and everything should be installed.
